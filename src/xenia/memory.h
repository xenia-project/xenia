  // there's no way to disable only a specific callback for a page. Also
  // callbacks may be triggered spuriously, and handlers should properly ignore
  // pages they don't care about.
  //
  // Once callbacks are triggered for a page, the page is not watched anymore
  // until requested again later. It is, however, unwatched only in one guest
  // view of physical memory (because different views may have different
  // protection for the same memory) - but it's rare when the same memory is
  // used with different guest page sizes, and it's okay to fire a callback more
  // than once.
  //
  // Only accessing the guest virtual memory views of physical memory triggers
  // callbacks - data providers, for instance, must write to the host physical
  // heap directly, otherwise their threads may infinitely await themselves.
  //
  // - Invalidation notifications:
  //
  // Protecting from writing. One-shot callbacks for invalidation of various
  // kinds of physical memory caches (such as the GPU copy of the memory).
  //
  // May be triggered for a single page (in case of a write access violation or
  // when need to synchronize data given by data providers) or for multiple
  // pages (like when memory is released, or explicitly to trigger callbacks
  // when host-side code can't rely on regular access violations, like when
  // accessing a file).
  //
  // Since granularity of callbacks is one single page, an invalidation
  // notification handler must invalidate the all the data stored in the touched
  // pages.
  //
  // Because large ranges (like whole framebuffers) may be written to and
  // exceptions are expensive, it's better to unprotect multiple pages as a
  // result of a write access violation, so the shortest common range returned
  // by all the invalidation callbacks (clamped to a sane range and also not to
