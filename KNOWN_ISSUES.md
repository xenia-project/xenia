## ARM64 CPU Backend Issues

### 1. Final CPU Test Failure (D3DCOLOR Pack Operation)
- **Status**: 1480/1481 CPU tests passing (99.93% compatibility)
- **Description**: One remaining test failure related to D3DCOLOR pack operations in vector sequences
- **Location**: `src/xenia/cpu/backend/a64/a64_seq_vector.cc`
- **Impact**: Minor - affects specific color packing operations
- **Priority**: Low (high compatibility already achieved)

### 2. Compiler Toolchain Differences (MSVC vs Clang)
- **Status**: Partially addressed through previous commits
- **Description**: ARM64 backend was originally designed for MSVC compiler behavior and required adaptations for Clang on macOS
- **Key Differences**:
  - Register allocation strategies differ between MSVC and Clang
  - ABI conventions vary between toolchains
  - Instruction scheduling assumptions needed adjustment
- **Examples of Required Fixes**:
  - Source operand ordering: `src2,src1` → `src1,src2` patterns
  - Register swapping in pack operations
  - Instruction sequence modifications
- **Commits**: 4e8aa29f0, 4f240879e, 114fe514d (now reverted for clean state)
- **Priority**: Medium (affects platform compatibility)

## Memory Management Issues

### 3. High Address Space Allocation on macOS ARM64
- **Status**: Workarounds implemented
- **Description**: macOS ARM64 often allocates memory in high address space (>32-bit), causing compatibility issues with code expecting 32-bit addresses
- **Affected Areas**:
  - Constant data placement (`PlaceConstData()`)
  - Function machine code addresses
  - Indirection table mapping
- **Current Workarounds**:
  - Added high address detection and warnings
  - Modified `ResolveFunction` to handle 64-bit addresses
  - Platform-specific code paths for address handling
- **Impact**: Potential runtime issues if high addresses aren't handled properly
- **Priority**: High (affects core functionality)

### 4. Function Resolution Context Issues
- **Status**: Debugging in progress
- **Description**: CallIndirect operations sometimes receive context pointers instead of function addresses
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Addresses like `0x0000000AD08DC000` appearing in function resolution
  - Pattern suggests context pointer being passed as target address
- **Location**: `CallIndirect()` and `ResolveFunction()` functions
- **Impact**: Function calls may fail or resolve incorrectly
- **Priority**: High (affects emulation correctness)

## Build System Issues

### 5. Platform-Specific Build Configuration
- **Status**: Needs improvement
- **Description**: Build system lacks proper detection and handling of macOS ARM64 specific requirements
- **Issues**:
  - Missing compiler-specific flags
  - Inadequate toolchain detection
  - Platform-specific library handling
- **Priority**: Medium (affects development workflow)

## Performance Issues

### 6. oaknut ARM64 Assembler Integration
- **Status**: Functional but not optimized
- **Description**: Current integration with oaknut assembler library may not be fully optimized for macOS ARM64
- **Potential Improvements**:
  - Better utilization of ARM64-specific instructions
  - Optimization for Apple Silicon features
  - Improved instruction scheduling
- **Priority**: Low (functionality over performance currently)

## Testing Issues

### 7. Incomplete Test Coverage for macOS ARM64
- **Status**: Basic CPU tests passing, but limited platform-specific testing
- **Description**: Need more comprehensive testing for macOS ARM64 specific behaviors
- **Missing Areas**:
  - Memory mapping edge cases
  - High address space handling
  - Compiler-specific behavior validation
- **Priority**: Medium (ensures stability)

## Future Improvements

### 8. Code Quality and Maintainability
- **Description**: Current ARM64 port contains platform-specific workarounds that should be cleaned up
- **Improvements Needed**:
  - Better abstraction of platform differences
  - Cleaner separation of MSVC vs Clang specific code
  - More robust error handling for address space issues
- **Priority**: Low (technical debt)

---

## Development Notes

### Testing Status (as of last check)
- Repository reset to commit 371829822: "Final ARM64 CPU backend fixes: reduce remaining test failures to 1"
- Clean state with 1 remaining CPU test failure
- Ready for systematic debugging and fixes

### Investigation Summary
The ARM64 macOS port faces primarily two categories of issues:
1. **Compiler compatibility** - Differences between MSVC (Windows) and Clang (macOS) toolchains
2. **Memory management** - macOS ARM64's high address space allocation patterns

Most critical functionality is working, with the main focus needed on polish and edge case handling.

## Test Results

### CPU Instruction Tests (xenia-cpu-tests) - Current Status

**Status**: 3 failures out of 88 tests on ARM64 macOS (96.6% pass rate)

**Failing Tests**:

1. **PACK_FLOAT16_2** (`src/xenia/cpu/testing/pack_test.cc:38`)
   - **Expected**: `[00000000 00000000 00000000 7FFFFFFF]`
   - **Actual**: `[00000000 00000000 00000000 7C00FC00]`
   - **Issue**: Float16 packing producing incorrect bit patterns for special values

2. **PACK_SHORT_2** (`src/xenia/cpu/testing/pack_test.cc:87`) 
   - **Expected**: `[00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000]`
   - **Actual**: `[00000000 00000000 00000000 80018001]`
   - **Issue**: Short packing not handling saturation/clamping correctly

3. **UNPACK_FLOAT16_2** (`src/xenia/cpu/testing/unpack_test.cc:44`)
   - **Expected**: `[47FFE000 C7FFE000 00000000 3F800000]` 
   - **Actual**: `[7FFFE000 FFFFE000 00000000 3F800000]`
   - **Issue**: Float16 unpacking producing incorrect exponent handling

**Root Cause**: These failures appear to be related to ARM64-specific vector instruction implementations for data format conversion operations (pack/unpack). The ARM64 backend may have different handling of:
- Float16 special values (NaN, infinity) 
- Saturation behavior in integer packing
- Sign extension in unpacking operations

**Impact**: These are specialized data conversion operations primarily used for GPU-related processing. Core emulation functionality appears unaffected.

**Priority**: Medium - The failures are in specialized vector operations rather than core CPU emulation.

## Runtime Issues

### XAM Module Initialization Failure (August 2025)
- **Status**: ❌ BLOCKING - Program crashes at startup
- **Description**: Successful FFmpeg ARM64 compatibility and build completion, but runtime failure during Xbox Application Model (XAM) initialization
- **Error Details**:
  ```
  Assertion failed: (export_entry->ordinal < xam_exports.size()), 
  function RegisterExport_xam, file xam_module.cc, line 40.
  
  Thread 0 crashed:
  xe::kernel::xam::RegisterExport_xam(xe::cpu::Export*) + 88 
  __cxx_global_var_init.13 + 36 at xam_avatar.cc:31:1
  DECLARE_XAM_EXPORT1(XamAvatarInitialize, kAvatars, kStub);
  ```
- **Location**: 
  - `src/xenia/kernel/xam/xam_module.cc:40`
  - `src/xenia/kernel/xam/xam_avatar.cc:31`
- **Analysis**: 
  - The XAM export system expects a specific export table size
  - Export ordinal validation is failing during global constructor initialization
  - Likely related to export table setup differences between platforms
- **Build Status**: ✅ Complete success including:
  - FFmpeg ARM64 compatibility (disabled NEON optimizations)
  - Audio subsystem with XMAFRAMES codec support
  - GPU trace utilities build successfully (`xenia-gpu-vulkan-trace-dump`)
- **Impact**: Prevents any program execution beyond initialization
- **Priority**: HIGH - Blocking all runtime functionality

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate XAM export table initialization and sizing
2. Compare export ordinal assignment between platforms
3. Debug global constructor ordering issues
4. Verify XAM module setup for macOS ARM64
