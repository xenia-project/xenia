This is automated checker to make sure a C++ file follows Google's C++ style
guide (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml). As it
heavily relies on regular expressions, cpplint.py won't catch all violations of
the style guide and will very occasionally report a false positive. There is a
list of things we currently don't handle very well at the top of cpplint.py,
and we welcome patches to improve it.

The linting tool takes a list of files as input. For full usage instructions,
please see the output of:

  ./cpplint.py --help

Unit tests are provided in cpplint_unittest.py. This file can safely be ignored
by end users who have downloaded this package and only want to run the lint
tool.
